# Computational Arabic
A GitHub repository which aims to collect any instance that builds, adds, and modifies the notion of "Computational Arabic" through collective open-source participation. While Computing has always held sociological and theoretical implications, Computational Arabic seeks to intersect all aspects of an Arab socio-cultural landscape. 

To contribute to the repo, message me for a Collaborators Invite.
