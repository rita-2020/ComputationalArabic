# Computational Arabic
A GitHub repository which aims to collect any instance that builds, adds, and modifies the notion of "Computational Arabic" through collective open-source participation. While Computing has always held sociological and theoretical implications, Computational Arabic seeks to intersect all aspects of an Arab socio-cultural landscape. 

To contribute to the repo, message me for a collaborators invitation.
#### you will need to have [hugo installed](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)

Then ; 

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/rita-2020/ComputationalArabic.git 
    #make sure to add --recursive, to include the submodules.

Then you must manually copy-paste my modified version of the hugo sk2 theme. 
ComputationalArabic > themes > sk2 is cloned as an empty folder, so go back to the "themes" file on this repository and download to replace.
